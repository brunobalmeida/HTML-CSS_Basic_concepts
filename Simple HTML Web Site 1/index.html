                        <p>Scrapbooking is a method, an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card. Typical memorabilia (objects treasured for their memories or historical interest) include photographs, printed media, and artwork. Scrapbooking is a hobby commonly practiced in many parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>A number of years ago, scrapbooks were no more than clippings from newspapers and stuff. There is, however, one thing that all good scrapbook pages do: they tell a story. A scrapbook is a story and scrapbooking is storytelling at a precious, personal level. It is organizing moments of the past so they have meaning for future generations. It is a recognition that events make up lives, and it is a celebration of living. Scrapbookers today are preserving yesterday for tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>Candle-making has been around for centuries. It is an art that has survived the test of time and is still a very popular craft project today. There are a few things to consider when attempting this craft, including the type of candle, type of wax, and the materials to use.</p>
                        <p>First things first. There are three main types of candles: pillar candles, container candles, and votive candles. Pillar candles require hard wax, because they are not formed in a container and are free-standing. Container candles are the most popular type of candles and are the easiest for beginners to make. Votive candles are small in size and are typically placed into a container when burning. They are commonly used at weddings and in places of worship. </p>
