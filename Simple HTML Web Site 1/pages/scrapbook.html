                        <p>A number of years ago, scrapbooks were usually little more than clippings from newspapers, snippets of hair and baby announcements. There were "wedding albums" and "baby books" and some family treasures stowed in albums somewhere. To some, that will always be the definition of a scrapbook. A scrapbook, you see, means different things to different people. And they are all right.</p>
                        <p>Some scrapbook albums have lots of journaling, some have none, some have a simplified style, others are very complex. There are scrapbookers who preach double page layouts, others, single page layouts. Some trumpet 12x12 pages, and for others 8 1/2 x 11 pages rule the day. Stickers and die cuts may be the main attractions or tear art and decorative paper may take center stage. Some scrapbookers keep their layouts in neat, catalogued binders, while others showcase their work on living room walls. </p>
						<p>There is, however, one thing that all good scrapbook pages do: they tell a story. A scrapbook is a story and scrapbooking is storytelling at a precious, personal level. It is organizing moments of the past so they have meaning for future generations. It is a recognition that events make up lives, and it is a celebration of living. Embodied in every scrapbook page is a celebration of life, a moment or moments captured that are especially unique to a person or family. Scrapbookers today are preserving yesterday for tomorrow.</p>
